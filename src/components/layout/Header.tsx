        across enterprise systems and SaaS solutions, I bring deep technical
        skills in React, Next.js, Angular, and Tailwindâ€”combined with a strong
        understanding of user experience, system architecture, and clean code
        principles. Whether building from scratch or optimizing large codebases,
        I focus on delivering maintainable, high-impact solutions that scale
        with your needs.
